dots is a simple (in early development) OS for DCPU 16. It can be built using 0x10c DevKit (http://0x10c-devkit.com/).
The source uses its macro capabilities heavily.

The project is divided into several sub-projects:
Core - The kernel proper
StackCall - Calling convention definitioins
Hal - Simple Hardware Abstraction Layer
Std - Math, String, Mem functions
InitProc - Initializes the Hardware

The sub-projects are not yet completed, with many missing functions.
